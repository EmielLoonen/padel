# Business Analyst Initiative Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Business Analyst to validate initiative readiness, requirements quality, and stakeholder alignment throughout the complete BA process cycle. Based on the [Business Analyst Initiative Checklist](https://backbase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~62b5764184d73c72016957a3/pages/5855970334/Business+Analyst+Initiative+Checklist), this validation ensures each phase is thoroughly completed before progression to the next stage.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. initiative-brief.md - Initiative brief from Product Manager (check docs/initiative-brief.md)
2. prd.md or frd.md - Product/Functional Requirements Document (check docs/)
3. market-research.md - Market research document (check docs/market-research.md)
4. competitor-analysis.md - Competitive analysis document (check docs/competitor-analysis.md)
5. process-diagrams.md or BPMN diagrams - Business process flows
6. data-models.md - Data models and integration specifications
7. Stakeholder documentation and contact information
8. Any existing system documentation for brownfield projects
9. UX wireframes and prototypes if available
10. Security and compliance requirements documentation

IMPORTANT: If any critical documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

- Is this a greenfield (new) or brownfield (existing system enhancement) project?
- Does this involve customer-facing features or internal banking/financial tools?
- What platforms are impacted (Web, Mobile, Service)?
- What is the regulatory context (AML, KYC, PSD2, data privacy laws)?
- Is this MVP or post-MVP scope?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Process Validation - Ensure each BA process step has been completed thoroughly
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Stakeholder Alignment - Verify all required stakeholder interactions have occurred
4. Risk Assessment - Consider business, technical, regulatory, and delivery risks
5. Financial Services Focus - Apply banking industry best practices and regulatory requirements

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]
