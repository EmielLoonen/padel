# Android Developer Checklist

## Instructions for Android Developer Agent

Before coding, ensure you have activated the ai logging system and completed all Android development setup requirements.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - ANDROID DEV CHECKLIST VALIDATION

This checklist is for ANDROID DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate they are ready to code with Android SDK 36, Kotlin 2.1.10, and Koin 4.0.2.

IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. It's better to identify issues now than have them found in review.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually implemented
5. Flag any concerns or technical debt created

The goal is quality delivery, not just checking boxes.]]
