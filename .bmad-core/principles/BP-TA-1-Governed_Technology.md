# Governed Technology Selection

**Original**: Selection of Technology Tools and Frameworks is Governed

Principle Reference: BP-TA-1

## Statement

The selection of technology, tools, and frameworks for the software lifecycle and runtime environment follows a governed, platform-level process.

## Rational

Standardizing technology reduces complexity, operational burden, and cost. A governance process ensures consistency and supports a unified platform approach while allowing for innovation.

## Implications

- Technology adoption is managed through the Backbase Technology Radar.
- All technology decisions must follow the Technology Evaluation process.
- The process must consider the impact on both customer-hosted and BaaS deployments.
