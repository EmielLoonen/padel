# Selective Identity Flexibility and Replaceability

**Original**: Backbase Identity offers Flexibility and Replaceability Only for Specific Use Cases

Principle Reference: IAM-SA-02

## Statement

The Backbase Identity Solution Platform Component is replaceable and extensible only in specific, documented areas where there is a valid business case.

## Rational

Investment in the Identity product is targeted where it provides the most business value. Prioritizing all features for replaceability is not a valuable use of resources.

## Implications

- The Identity Product team governs which features are extensible and replaceable.
- Features will be flagged in the documentation as replaceable or extensible.
- Non-replaceable features are not guaranteed to work with a third-party IdP.
- Non-extensible features have not been designed for customization.
