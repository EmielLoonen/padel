# Design for Production

**Original**: Design for Production

Principle Reference: BP-PCA-8

## Statement

All functionality must be designed and built with production readiness in mind, including non-functional requirements, operational costs, and ease of implementation.

## Rational

This ensures that the platform is reliable, performant, and easy to manage in a production environment, bridging the gap between R&D and implementation teams.

## Implications

- Non-functional requirements must be defined and tested against a 'Golden Bank' reference.
- The impact of design decisions on operational costs must be assessed early.
- Operational management enablers like observability and security must be built-in.
- A close feedback loop between implementation partners and R&D is essential.
