# Engaging Engagement Banking Users

**Original**: Digital Engage engages Engagement Banking Users

Principle Reference: EM-BA-1

## Statement

Any known user of the Backbase platform can be engaged using the Digital Engage product.

## Rational

Digital Engage's unique proposition is its seamless integration with Backbase applications, using both internal and external channels to engage users of Backbase apps.

## Implications

- All Digital Engage capabilities operate with the internal user ID.
- Engagement of anonymous or non-Backbase users is out of scope.
- The Engage App is sold as part of a Digital Banking product line, not as a standalone product.
- External channels are integrated, not built from scratch.
