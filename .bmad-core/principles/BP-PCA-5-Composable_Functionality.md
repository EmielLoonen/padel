# Composable Platform Functionality

**Original**: Platform functionality must be Composable where applicable

Principle Reference: BP-PCA-5

## Statement

Platform functionality must be composable, allowing customer-specific experiences to be built by selecting and combining journeys, capabilities, and integrations without obstruction.

## Rational

The platform must be adaptable to diverse customer contexts, enabling the composition of tailored experiences for various lines of business (LoB) and functional requirements.

## Implications

- Capabilities must support deployment across multiple LoBs in a single runtime.
- Journey composability needs to be documented and supported in both web and mobile applications.
- The platform must support integration of journeys into external applications.
- Business Process Orchestration must allow for seamless selection and replacement of capabilities.
- Integration composition is facilitated through Grand Central.
