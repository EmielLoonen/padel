# READ ME FIRST

Originally we tried to add default content to each section, however, as one of the aims of the document was to not repeat product documentation, it means that the Technical Architecture Document (TAD) is really only left with customer specific information.  While some default content remains, most of the document contains instructions or discussion points as highlighted in yellow.

If during an inception you feel something is missing, or you have some default content that you think could be reused, please contribute it back to the TAD.  **You can do this by adding comments.**

# Guidelines {#guidelines}

* **COPY THIS TEMPLATE.**  
* **LEAVE COMMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL CONTENT OR IMPROVEMENTS**  
* **Get your TAD reviewed by at least 2 other SAs before sharing with customer**  
* Do **NOT** repeat content that is already in product documentation  
* For BAAS projects, the infrastructure section should point to the BAAS documentation (when available)  
* TAD is a living document, update it throughout the lifecycle of the project  
* Use the automatic numbering for section and subsection headers (or at least try, Google does not make it easy)  
* Instructions or discussion points for the SA are highlighted in yellow.   
* The SA should **remove all yellow sections** before sending the TAD to the customer, however we do advise to **leave the** **links to backbase.io in the document** for easy reference for the customer to product documentation   
* There is some default text in the document which you can use if applicable, but please **read it first** to determine if it is relevant.  
* Please **contribute back** to the TAD if you believe you have some reusable content.  
* Use **LATEST** links to backbase.io and make sure to change it to the actual product version before delivering the TAD  
* Use American English (color not colour, initialize not initialise etc, )  
* Use spell check\!\!\!\!\!  
* Use Roboto font\! (it does not default to this, you need to change it)

# Formatting

Google Document styles are not so easy to use.  Indentation in particular has a mind of its own.  If you get into trouble with indentation, you might have to manually control it.

#### **Tip:** {#tip:}

From the menu, select Format \-\> Align & Indent \-\>Indentation Options  
In this document, the following settings were used:

* **All levels of headers**  
  * Left: 0  
  * Special Indent: Hanging, 0.25  
* **Normal Text**  
  * Left: 0.25  
  * Special Indent: Hanging, 0 (or just select none)
