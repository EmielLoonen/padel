        title: Purpose
        content: |
          The purpose of the TAD is to capture and detail all relevant architecture decisions made during the full lifecycle of the project. This includes the outcome of the Inception phase and any decisions or architectural changes taken throughout the duration of the project.
          
          Together with the Business Requirements (BRD) and the UX Strategy Documents, the TAD must remain a 'living' document, which is being updated regularly to reflect the latest state of the project.
          
          The following topics should be included in the TAD:
          
          * Infrastructure and deployment model
          * Integration points
          * Roles and responsibilities
          * Security solution
          * Non functional requirements
          * Use of Backbase products and components

          * All components will be securely deployed and integrated with a solid testing strategy
      - id: project-scope
        title: Project Scope
        instruction: |
          Define the project scope including Backbase components to be used.
          Reference the PRD and other documents to determine which Backbase capabilities are in scope.
        template: |
          Project scope agreed is to be all in Backbase out of the box capabilities aligning to a prescriptive way of working delivered as part of Model Bank.
          
          However this may change based on custom mandatory requirements based on the customer.
          
          In order to achieve the project vision following Backbase component will be used:
