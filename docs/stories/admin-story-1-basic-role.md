# Story 1: Admin Role with Session & Match Management

<!-- Source: epic-admin-role.md -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to Padel coordination app -->

## Status: Draft

---

## Story

As a **Padel app administrator (you)**,  
I want **the ability to edit and delete any session or match result**,  
so that **I can manage and correct group data regardless of who created it**.

---

## Context Source

- **Source Document:** docs/epic-admin-role.md (Story 1 of 3)
- **Enhancement Type:** Authorization enhancement - Admin role
- **Existing System Impact:** Extends authorization checks, no breaking changes
- **Epic Goal:** Enable admin oversight for all content

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### New Functionality

1. ‚úÖ User model has `isAdmin` boolean field
2. ‚úÖ Your account is set as admin (`isAdmin = true`)
3. ‚úÖ Admin can edit any session (sees edit button on all sessions)
4. ‚úÖ Admin can delete any session (sees delete button on all sessions)
5. ‚úÖ Admin can edit any match result (sees edit button on all matches)
6. ‚úÖ Admin can delete any match result (sees delete button on all matches)
7. ‚úÖ Admin badge (üõ°Ô∏è) displays next to admin's name in UI
8. ‚úÖ Authorization checks allow admin to bypass ownership checks

### Existing Functionality Protection

9. ‚úÖ Non-admin users can still only edit/delete their own content
10. ‚úÖ Existing sessions/matches remain unchanged
11. ‚úÖ Authentication flow unchanged (no need to re-login)
12. ‚úÖ API responses include `isAdmin` field for frontend
13. ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing authorization

### Technical Quality

14. ‚úÖ Database migration runs successfully
15. ‚úÖ Authorization pattern is consistent across all endpoints
16. ‚úÖ TypeScript types updated for User model
17. ‚úÖ Frontend conditionals correctly check admin status

---

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

**Current Authorization Pattern:**
- **Location:** Authorization checks in route handlers
- **Pattern:** Check if `createdById === userId`
- **Affected Endpoints:**
  - `PUT /api/sessions/:id` - Edit session
  - `DELETE /api/sessions/:id` - Delete session
  - `PUT /api/matches/:id` - Edit match
  - `DELETE /api/matches/:id` - Delete match

**Frontend Authorization:**
- **Session Detail Page:** Shows edit/delete only if user created the session
- **Match Results:** Shows edit/delete only if user created the match
- **Pattern:** `session.createdById === user.id`

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js 18+, Express 4.x, TypeScript 5.x
- ORM: Prisma 5.x with PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Zustand
- Auth: JWT tokens with user ID in payload

**User Model Location:**
- Schema: `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Auth service: `backend/src/services/authService.ts`
- User store: `frontend/src/store/authStore.ts`

---

### Integration Approach

**Architecture Decision:**
Add `isAdmin` field to User model and check it in authorization logic.

**Authorization Pattern Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
if (session.createdById !== userId) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
}

// AFTER
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
if (session.createdById !== userId && !user?.isAdmin) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
}
```

**Frontend Pattern Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
{session.createdById === user?.id && (
  <button>Edit</button>
)}

// AFTER
{(session.createdById === user?.id || user?.isAdmin) && (
  <button>Edit</button>
)}
```

---

### Technical Constraints

1. **Must use database migration**
   - Add field via Prisma migration
   - Default value: `false`
   - Existing users remain non-admin
   
2. **Must fetch user for each authorization check**
   - Can't rely on JWT payload (doesn't include isAdmin)
   - Need to query database for user role
   - Consider caching if performance issue
   
3. **Must update all authorization checks**
   - Session edit/delete (2 endpoints)
   - Match edit/delete (2 endpoints)
   - Consistent pattern across all

4. **Must include isAdmin in API responses**
   - Auth endpoints return user with isAdmin
   - Frontend needs isAdmin to show buttons

5. **Must display admin badge**
   - Show üõ°Ô∏è next to admin names
   - Check in user display components

---

### Key Implementation Files

**Backend:**
1. **MODIFY:** `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Add `isAdmin Boolean @default(false)`
2. **CREATE:** Migration file via `prisma migrate dev`
3. **MODIFY:** `backend/src/routes/sessions.ts` - Update PUT and DELETE authorization
4. **MODIFY:** `backend/src/routes/matches.ts` - Update PUT and DELETE authorization
5. **MODIFY:** `backend/src/services/authService.ts` - Include isAdmin in responses (if needed)

**Frontend:**
6. **MODIFY:** `frontend/src/store/authStore.ts` - Add isAdmin to User type
7. **MODIFY:** `frontend/src/pages/SessionDetailPage.tsx` - Update edit/delete conditionals
8. **MODIFY:** `frontend/src/components/Avatar.tsx` or user display - Add admin badge

**Script:**
9. **CREATE:** `backend/prisma/set-admin.ts` - Script to set your account as admin

---

### Admin Assignment

**Your Account Email:** (You'll need to provide this)

**Script to Set Admin:**
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function setAdmin() {
  const adminEmail = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com'; // Replace with your email
  
  const user = await prisma.user.update({
    where: { email: adminEmail },
    data: { isAdmin: true },
  });
  
  console.log(`‚úÖ Set ${user.name} (${user.email}) as admin`);
}

setAdmin();
```

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Update Database Schema & Migration

- [ ] Open `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- [ ] Add `isAdmin Boolean @default(false)` to User model
- [ ] Run `cd backend && pnpm prisma migrate dev --name add-admin-role`
- [ ] Verify migration created successfully
- [ ] Check migration file in `backend/prisma/migrations/`

**Acceptance:** User model has isAdmin field, migration applied

---

### Task 2: Set Your Account as Admin

- [ ] Create script `backend/prisma/set-admin.ts` (use template above)
- [ ] Update script with your actual email address
- [ ] Run: `cd backend && pnpm tsx prisma/set-admin.ts`
- [ ] Verify in database or Prisma Studio that your user has `isAdmin = true`

**Alternative (Manual SQL):**
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com';
```

**Acceptance:** Your user account has isAdmin = true in database

---

### Task 3: Update Backend Authorization - Sessions

- [ ] Open `backend/src/routes/sessions.ts`
- [ ] Find the `PUT /:id` (update session) route handler
- [ ] Update authorization check:
  ```typescript
  // Fetch user to check admin status
  const requestingUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId },
  });
  
  // Check authorization
  if (session.createdById !== userId && !requestingUser?.isAdmin) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  ```
- [ ] Find the `DELETE /:id` route handler
- [ ] Apply same authorization pattern
- [ ] Test TypeScript compilation

**Acceptance:** Session edit/delete routes check admin status

---

### Task 4: Update Backend Authorization - Matches

- [ ] Open `backend/src/routes/matches.ts`
- [ ] Find the `PUT /:id` (update match) route handler
- [ ] Update authorization check (same pattern as Task 3):
  ```typescript
  const requestingUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId },
  });
  
  if (match.createdById !== userId && !requestingUser?.isAdmin) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  ```
- [ ] Find the `DELETE /:id` route handler
- [ ] Apply same authorization pattern
- [ ] Test TypeScript compilation

**Acceptance:** Match edit/delete routes check admin status

---

### Task 5: Update Frontend User Type

- [ ] Open `frontend/src/store/authStore.ts`
- [ ] Update User interface to include `isAdmin?: boolean;`
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Check that auth responses include isAdmin field

**Note:** Backend auth endpoints should already return full user object including isAdmin after migration.

**Acceptance:** Frontend User type includes isAdmin field

---

### Task 6: Update Frontend - Session Detail Page

- [ ] Open `frontend/src/pages/SessionDetailPage.tsx`
- [ ] Find the edit session button conditional (around line with `session.createdById === user?.id`)
- [ ] Update to: `(session.createdById === user?.id || user?.isAdmin)`
- [ ] Find the delete session button conditional
- [ ] Update with same pattern
- [ ] Test TypeScript compilation

**Acceptance:** Admin sees edit/delete buttons on all sessions

---

### Task 7: Update Frontend - Match Results

- [ ] In `frontend/src/pages/SessionDetailPage.tsx`
- [ ] Find match result edit/delete button conditionals
- [ ] Update to: `(match.createdById === user?.id || user?.isAdmin)`
- [ ] Apply to both edit and delete buttons for each match

**Acceptance:** Admin sees edit/delete buttons on all match results

---

### Task 8: Add Admin Badge to UI

- [ ] Decide where to show admin badge:
  - Option A: Next to user name in header
  - Option B: On user profile/settings
  - Option C: Both
- [ ] Add admin badge display:
  ```tsx
  {user?.isAdmin && (
    <span className="ml-2 text-yellow-500" title="Admin">
      üõ°Ô∏è
    </span>
  )}
  ```
- [ ] Choose appropriate location(s) for badge
- [ ] Test badge appears for admin user

**Acceptance:** üõ°Ô∏è badge displays for admin user

---

### Task 9: Testing & Verification

**Admin Testing (Your Account):**
- [ ] Log in with your admin account
- [ ] Navigate to a session you didn't create
- [ ] Verify edit button is visible
- [ ] Click edit and modify session
- [ ] Verify changes save successfully
- [ ] Verify delete button is visible
- [ ] Navigate to a match result you didn't create
- [ ] Verify edit/delete buttons visible
- [ ] Test editing match result
- [ ] Verify admin badge (üõ°Ô∏è) displays

**Non-Admin Testing (Test Account):**
- [ ] Log in with a test/non-admin account
- [ ] Navigate to a session created by someone else
- [ ] Verify NO edit/delete buttons visible
- [ ] Navigate to own session
- [ ] Verify edit/delete buttons ARE visible (normal behavior)
- [ ] Verify NO admin badge displays

**API Testing:**
- [ ] Test admin can PUT/DELETE any session (should succeed)
- [ ] Test non-admin trying to PUT/DELETE others' session (should fail with 403)

**Acceptance:** All admin and non-admin scenarios work correctly

---

### Task 10: Code Review & Cleanup

- [ ] Review all authorization checks for consistency
- [ ] Ensure error handling is proper
- [ ] Remove any debug console.logs
- [ ] Verify TypeScript has no errors
- [ ] Check linter passes
- [ ] Verify all imports are correct

**Acceptance:** Code is clean and follows project standards

---

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

**Primary Risk:** Authorization bypass bug could allow non-admins to edit others' content

**Mitigation:**
- Use consistent pattern across all endpoints
- Test both admin and non-admin scenarios thoroughly
- Double-check logical operators (`&&` vs `||`)

**Verification:**
- Manual testing with admin and non-admin accounts
- Test editing own content (should work for both)
- Test editing others' content (should only work for admin)

---

### Secondary Risk: Wrong user set as admin

**Mitigation:**
- Admin script requires explicit email
- Easy to verify in database
- Easy to revoke by setting `isAdmin = false`

**Verification:**
- Check database after running script
- Test with correct account

---

### Rollback Plan

If admin feature causes issues:

1. **Quick Fix:** Set all users to `isAdmin = false` in database
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET is_admin = false;
   ```
2. **Revert Code:** Git revert the changes (frontend conditionals, backend checks)
3. **Keep Migration:** Can leave isAdmin field (harmless if all false)

**Key:** Non-admin authorization remains unchanged, so system degrades gracefully

## Notes for Dev Agent

1. **Email Address:** Ask user for their email to set as admin
2. **Authorization Pattern:** Be consistent - fetch user, check `!isAdmin` in all 4 endpoints
3. **Frontend Pattern:** Add `|| user?.isAdmin` to all ownership checks
4. **Badge Location:** Suggest header next to user name for visibility
5. **Testing:** Must test both admin and non-admin scenarios
6. **Migration:** Run `prisma migrate dev` not `prisma db push`
